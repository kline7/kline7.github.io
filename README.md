Hello, this is the source code for my new personal website. This website is made with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and hosted in [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
I update this project every time I upload a new blog post, add/update a project on the projects page, when I encounter an issue to fix, and when I want to add a new feature.

You can [create an Issue](https://github.com/lancerossdev/lanceross.xyz/issues/new) if you think there's something wrong or you want to recommend a feature on my website. I appreciate your help!

## Dev Notes üìù

You can use `npm i` or `pnpm i` to install dependencies. I personally use `yarn` because it's what I use on most of my projects.

`yarn` - Installs dependencies. You can use any of those.

`yarn dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`

`yarn build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`

`yarn preview` - Preview your build locally, before deploying

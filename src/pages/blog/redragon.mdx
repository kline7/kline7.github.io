Hey there! It’s been a while since my last blog post and also, belated Happy New Year to y'all! I’ve been busy with school activities so I have no time to do stuff lately. I just want to share my new keyboard that I bought recently!

## The Keyboard

This is the Redragon Fizz K617. I bought this keyboard because I thought my keyboard doesn't actually work even so it does after fixing it, and I totally regret it but I'm excited to showcase it here lol. I bought this keyboard for around 30 USD here in the Philippines and I think it’s a good deal.

Here is a quick preview of the keyboard:

## Thoughts about it

### Design

The 2-toned keycap color is what I really like about this keyboard. It makes it unique among the other Redragon's Keyboard. Overall, the design is simple and it looks good. The RGB lighting is optional to me since I don't really use it (just for flexing).

The body of the keyboard has thick borders unlike my old one which is thin. It's not a big deal to me but it just feels like a big keyboard to me.

### Usability

I have a few cons here. First of all is it only comes with wired mode and doesn't have wireless option. It's not of a big deal to me using wired mode on a keyboard and since it's out of the budget, but using wireless peripherals just makes it look you have a clean desk setup in my opinion.

The switches are not that bad. It has Redragon Red switches which is a linear switch. I'm a big fan of linear switches and I think it's a good choice for a budget keyboard.

## Conclusion

Overall, I think this keyboard is a good buy for a budget gaming keyboard. I've used this keyboard for a few days and it was alright. However, if you have more budget, I suggest you buy a better keyboard. I'm planning to buy a new computer mouse soon! I hope you enjoyed this review and I'll see you in my next blog post!

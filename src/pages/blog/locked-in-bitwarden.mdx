As the title says, I got locked in my own Bitwarden Vault and here is the story how it happened and how did I recover it.

## The Story

It happened when I was about to back up my KeePassXC Database to my USB Drive and instead of just copying it, I moved the file and accidentally deleted one file which will lead to data loss. The file that I accidentally deleted is `passwords.txt` which contains the password for my Bitwarden and KeePassXC Database.

Now, before you judge me that I store passwords in plain text, I temporarily store them there because I got busy and I forgot to write them down on a piece of paper. I was in a hurry and I just have one file that I can store it in. I know it’s not a good practice and I make mistakes too 😭

I was so frustrated and I was worried that I might not open my accounts ever again because I don’t have the password for it.

## How did I recover it? 🔍

Here’s the thing. Yesterday, I exported a copy of my Bitwarden Vault and I got so lucky that I have a copy of it in my Recycle Bin. I just need to create a new KeePass Database and import the CSV File so I can access all my accounts again.

The thing here is that I won’t be able to log in to my Bitwarden Account anymore. All I did is asked the support team to delete my account so I can create a new one since Bitwarden cannot recover your passwords for you and I understand that.

Edit: All things are back to normal! I deleted my Bitwarden Account and created a new one. I also imported the CSV File I was talking about for a while. I am a really lucky guy 😅

## Conclusion 📚

I learned a lesson for today, always have a backup of your passwords and think twice before doing something that you will regret.
